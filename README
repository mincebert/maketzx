RAMSOFT MakeTZX v1.02.1 SOURCE CODE
-----------------------------------

PLEASE READ DISCLAIM.TXT FOR THE DISCLAIMER !

Due to the large number of requests, we have decided to release the
sources of the latest version based on the old v1.xx engine.

If you are going to use this code in any way,  we'd like to be informed
about your projects and credited. We have spent many hours on MakeTZX, 
it's like a pet for us... :)
We are happy if someone wants to port MakeTZX to other platforms (eg any
68K), but again please tell us, we like to know how MakeTZX is being
spread.
It would be nice if you send your works to us too.

The code consists in a monolithic C module, so it's not exactly well
designed and absolutely unreadable. It's not even portable, because the
original project was intended for DOS only and developed for a 16 bit
environment. You'll get in big troubles trying to do anything with it!
We are sorry about that, but it is provided AS IS.

For these reasons, we decided to drop everything and restart from scratch
with a brand new engine, better structured and easily expandable. MakeTZX
v2.xx is in C++ and every single algorithm has been rewritten and
improved (pulse detection, advanced error correction, realtime decoding,
multiformat support, decoding schemes and so on). Just for comparison,
MakeTZX v2.11 consists in 42 source files for a total of 300 KB.
At the moment, MakeTZX 2 is the only tool which offers TRUE and reliable
REALTIME conversion (have you tried it?).

For the moment, we are going to keep the v2 sources for us and eventually
release them when the new v3.xx is out.
