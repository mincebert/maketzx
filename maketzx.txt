Notes about the LINUX version (disclaimer)
------------------------------------------

MakeTZX has been developed under and for the MSDOS platform. The present
executable is the result of the direct porting of the DOS sources to work
with the GNU compiler, so it is NOT a Linux native version.
This means that the program's behaviour is exactly the same as the
DOS version's one -- not a bug less, not a bug more (if any).
Future versions are planned to be more portable to the Unix environment
and a major v2.x is currently under development.
In conclusion, no warranty of any kind is provided and if you decide to
use the program you do it at your own risk. The authors will not be
responsable for damages and losses caused to your system directly
or indirectly by the use of MakeTZX. 
Of course this doesn't mean that MakeTZX can format your partition! :)

Introduction
------------

MakeTZX is a TZX converter for VOC files: it can convert loaders like 
Speedlock (all 7 versions), Alkatraz, Bleepload, Softlock and ZetaLoad
(Ramsoft's custom tape format). It uses TZX revision 1.10 by default and
optionally 1.10 which can shorten file lengths very much (in particular for
Speedlock loaders). Other interesting features are: extremely low system
requirements (works on a plain 286 and doesn't require any memory manager 
- of course this applies to MSDOS version only) and high conversion rates
(nearly 98% !!!)


Syntax and command line switches
--------------------------------

The syntax couldn't be simpler :

MAKETZX <vocfile>[.VOC] [tzxfile[.TZX]] [-switches]

You can specify a loading standard by using a particular switch; if NONE is
specified then the program will operate in RAW mode. RAW mode can decode any
turbo loading system including Alkatraz and Softlock (it will automatically
try to detect the loading speed) but not Speedlock and Bleepload.

Here's a list of all available switches:

-n : tells the program to operate in NORMAL mode only, i.e. with the
     timings of the ROM loader

-a : this is used when converting programs protected by the Alkatraz
     protection system (games like Ghouls'n'ghosts, Ghostbusters II, 10th
     frame, Forgotten worlds and many others)

-f : enables the Softlock decoding algorithm (games like Cylu and Chimera)

-b : tells the program to use Bleepload algorithm (Bubble Bobble)

-s n : uses Speedlock n algorithm. n could be any number between 1 and 7
       (see below how to distinguish different versions)

-z : this is used when converting programs encoded with ZetaLoad
     loading system by Ramsoft

-k n : tells the program to override the default number of blocks to
       skip before considering encoded data blocks

-x : displays file informations in hex form (except for block numbers and
     pauses)

-l : generates a log file to easy locate decoding errors

-q : disables hi-fi decoding tones reproduction (for Speedlock loaders)

-r : uses TZX 1.01 specifications

NOTE that you can specify only ONE decoding algorithm (otherwise an error
message is given).


How to identify Speedlock versions
----------------------------------

There are seven different versions of Speedlock loaders.

Type 1
======

- 1 or 2 normal speed blocks (both BASIC, first one very short)
- clicking pilot
- STANDARD colours
- high speed loading (nearly 150% of normal)
- no encryption
- 48k only programs

Examples : Highway encounter, JetSet Willy, Daley Thompson's Decathlon
           Day 1 and 2.

Type 2
======

- 2 normal speed blocks (both BASIC, first one very short)
- clicking pilot
- NON standard colours (RED/BLACK - BLUE/BLACK)
- high speed loading (nearly 150% of normal)
- ENCRYPTED data
- 48 and 128k programs

Examples : Enduro racer, Knight rider.

Type 3
======

- 2 normal speed blocks (one BASIC, one CODE)
- Bubbling sounds (NOT needed by decrypter) and flashing colours on border
  while decrypting.
- clicking pilot
- NON standard colours (RED/BLACK - BLUE/BLACK)
- high speed loading (nearly 150% of normal)
- ENCRYPTED data
- 48 and 128k programs

Examples : Leviathan 48 and 128k

Type 4
======

- 2 normal speed blocks (one short BASIC, one long CODE)
- Bubbling sounds (NOT needed by decrypter - i.e. you could stop the tape)
  and flashing colours on border
  while decrypting.
- NON clicking pilot
- NON standard colours (RED/BLACK - BLUE/BLACK)
- high speed loading (nearly 150% of normal)
- ENCRYPTED data
- 48 and 128k programs

Examples : Athena 48 and 128k

Type 5
======

- 2 normal speed blocks (one short BASIC, one long CODE)
- Clicking tone or wave sequence (NEEDED by decrypter - i.e. if you stop the
  tape the computer will reset) and flashing colours
  on border while decrypting.
- NON clicking pilot
- NON standard colours (RED/BLACK - BLUE/BLACK)
- high speed loading (nearly 150% of normal)
- ENCRYPTED data
- 48 and 128k programs

Examples: Out run, Ping Pong, Winter games 1 and 2.

Type 6
======

- 2 normal speed blocks (one short BASIC, one long CODE)
- Clicking tone or wave sequence (NEEDED by decrypter - i.e. if you stop the
  tape the computer will reset) and flashing colours
  on border while decrypting.
- NON clicking pilot
- NON standard colours (RED/BLACK - BLUE/BLACK)
- MEDIUM speed loading (nearly 127% of normal)
- ENCRYPTED data
- 48 and 128k programs

Examples: Vixen.

Type 7
======

- 1 normal speed block (long BASIC)
- NO ACTION OR SOUNDS while decrypting.
- NON clicking pilot
- NON standard colours (RED/BLACK - BLUE/BLACK)
- MEDIUM speed loading (nearly 127% of normal)
- ENCRYPTED data
- 48 and 128k programs

Examples: Turrican, Myth, Operation Wolf 48 and 128k, Firefly, Arkanoid II,
          Tusker, The last ninja II, and many others!!!

NOTE: type 2 is very similar to type 1, type 4 is similar to type 3 and type
      6 is similar to type 5. If you don't succeed in correct conversions 
      please try even with more than one type.

Known limits and bugs
---------------------

- MakeTZX can't handle VOCs that use repetition (IDs 6 and 7).
- Optimal VOC sampling frequency is greater or equal than 20000 Hz. 
  However the program may work even with lower sample rates and warns
  you if the sample rate is under 11025 Hz.
- RAW mode may not work with very low sample rates
